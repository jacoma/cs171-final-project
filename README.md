# Smells Fishy

This repository contains our team's HTML file, our JS files and libraries, our CSS stylesheets, our .csv data, and the images included in the HTML.

The JS libraries we are using are:
- D3
- D3-tip
- D3-scale-chromatic
- D3-array
- JQuery
- Popper
- Queue

The rest of the .js files are our code.

In addition, we use Bootstrap to style our webpage layout.
