    <h1>What is Overfishing?</h1>
    <p>Ocean overfishing is simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace
        themselves. [3]</p>
    <p>The results <i>(of the Science study)</i> revealed that every species lost causes a faster unraveling of the overall ecosystem. This
    progressive biodiversity loss not only impairs the ability of the ocean to feed a growing human population
    but also sabotages the stability of marine environments, the authors said. Conversely, the study found that
    every species recovered adds significantly to the ecosystem's overall productivity and ability to withstand
    stresses. [2]</p>
    <h2>How did it start?</h2>
    <p>Marine scientists know when widespread overfishing of the seas began. And they have a pretty good idea when,
        if left unaddressed, it will end. In the mid-20th century, international efforts to increase the availability
        and affordability of protein-rich foods led to concerted government efforts to increase fishing capacity.
        Favorable policies, loans, and subsidies spawned a rapid rise of big industrial fishing operations, which
        quickly supplanted local boatmen as the world's source of seafood.[3]</p>
    <p>These large, profit-seeking commercial fleets were extremely aggressive, scouring the world's oceans and
        developing ever more sophisticated methods and technologies for finding, extracting, and processing their
        target species. Consumers soon grew accustomed to having access to a wide selection of fish species at
        affordable prices.[3]</p>
    <p>Over the past 55 years, as fisheries have returned lower and lower yields, humans have begun to understand
        that the oceans we'd assumed were unendingly vast and rich are in fact highly vulnerable and sensitive.
        Add overfishing to pollution, climate change, habitat destruction, and acidification, and a picture of a
        system in crisis emerges.[3]</p>

    <h1>Science study predicts collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050</h1>
<p>Unless we fundamentally change the way we manage all the ocean species together as working ecosystems, then this
    century is the last century of wild seafood.[2]</p>
    <p>Based on current global trends, the authors predicted that every species of wild-caught seafood—from tuna to
        sardines—will collapse by the year 2050. "Collapse" was defined as a 90 percent depletion of the species'
        baseline abundance.[2]</p>
    <p>"The ocean is a great recycler," Palumbi said. "It takes sewage and recycles it into nutrients, it scrubs toxins
        out of the water and it produces food and turns carbon dioxide into food and oxygen." But to provide these
        services, he added, the ocean needs all of its working parts—the millions of plant and animal species that
        inhabit the sea.[2]</p>


    <h1>What can we do to prevent the collapse?</h1>
    <p>Many scientists say most fish populations could be restored with aggressive fisheries management, better
        enforcement of laws governing catches, and increased use of aquaculture. And in many regions, there is
        reason for hope. But illegal fishing and unsustainable harvesting still plagues the industry. And a public
        grown accustomed to abundant seafood and largely apathetic about the plight of the oceans complicates efforts
        to repair the damage we've done. [3]</p>
